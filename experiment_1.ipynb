    "Your goal is to extract structured candidate data from raw Resume Markdown text with 100% precision.\n",
    "### CORE EXTRACTION RULES:\n",
    "1.  **Truthfulness:** Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the text. Do not infer or hallucinate data. If a field (like \"LinkedIn URL\" or \"End Date\") is missing, leave it as null/None. Do not invent \"N/A\" or placeholders.\n",
    "2.  **Date Normalization:** * Convert all dates to `YYYY-MM` format (e.g., \"August 2022\" -> \"2022-08\").\n",
    "    * If a candidate writes \"Present\", \"Current\", or \"Till Date\", set the `end_date` to None.\n",
    "3.  **Name Extraction:**\n",
    "    * If the resume has a header like \"Resume of John Doe\", extract only \"John Doe\".\n",
    "    * Do not include titles like \"Mr.\", \"Dr.\", or suffixes like \"PMP\" in the `full_name` field.\n",
    "4.  **Work Experience:**\n",
    "    * Split \"Role\" and \"Company\" if they appear on the same line (e.g., \"Software Engineer | Google\" -> Role: \"Software Engineer\", Company: \"Google\").\n",
    "    * If a description contains \"References available upon request\", ignore that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HANDLING EDGE CASES:\n",
    "1. **Multi-Role:** If a candidate held multiple roles at the same company, treat them as separate objects in `work_experience`.\n",
    "2. **Education:** Every new university/college in the education section should be treated as a separate object in `education`.\n",
    "3. If you dont find any data for a field, leave it as None.\n",
